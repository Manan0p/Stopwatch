Features
Start/Stop: Easily start and pause the stopwatch at any time.

Reset: Reset the timer back to zero.

Lap Times: Record and display an unlimited number of lap times.

Clean UI: A modern and responsive interface that looks great on all devices.

Organized Code: The project is split into three separate files (index.html, style.css, script.js) for better organization and maintainability.

How to Use
To run this application locally, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. All necessary dependencies (Tailwind CSS, Google Fonts) are loaded via a CDN, so no local installation is required.

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/stopwatch-app.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd stopwatch-app

Open index.html in a modern web browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.

Project Structure
The project is organized into three main files for a clear separation of concerns:

index.html: This is the main HTML file that provides the structure for the web application. It includes all the necessary elements like the time display, control buttons, and the laps list. It also links to the CSS and JavaScript files.

style.css: This file contains the custom CSS rules for the application. While most of the styling is handled by Tailwind CSS classes in the HTML, this file holds additional styles for things like custom fonts and scrollbar appearance.

script.js: This file contains all the JavaScript logic that powers the stopwatch. It handles the timer functionality, button events (start, stop, lap, reset), time formatting, and dynamically updating the DOM.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the core structure of the application.

CSS3: For custom styling and visual enhancements.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

JavaScript (ES6+): For all the interactive functionality and application logic.

Google Fonts: Used for the 'Inter' font to enhance typography.
